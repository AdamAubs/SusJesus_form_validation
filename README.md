# SusJesus Form Validation

Welcome to the **SusJesus Form Validation** project! This form validation tool ensures that your data is validated properly with a unique twist. No more boring validation messages, only **harsh truths** from SusJesus. If your form inputs are not up to the mark, youâ€™ll hear it directly from SusJesus, in a way only he can deliver.

## Features

- **Validation for multiple input types**: Supports number, word, color, and range inputs.
- **Custom error messages**: If the input is invalid, youâ€™ll get a personalized, no-nonsense message from SusJesus himself.
- **Real-time validation**: Errors are displayed as soon as the user enters invalid data, making it easier to fix mistakes without waiting for form submission.
- **Find SusJesus and the Cat**: The final validation tests if you can find SusJesus and the cat before time runs out. Fail, and you'll be redirected to a page where your validation message is repeated to you 1000 times, multiplied by your chosen validation number.
